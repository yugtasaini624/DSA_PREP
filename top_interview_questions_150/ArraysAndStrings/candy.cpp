/*
There are n children standing in a line.
Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array ratings.
You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:
    Each child must have at least one candy.
    Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.

Example 1:
Input: ratings = [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.

Example 2:
Input: ratings = [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.

Constraints:
    1 <= n == ratings.length <= 5 * 104
    0 <= ratings[i] <= 5 * 104
